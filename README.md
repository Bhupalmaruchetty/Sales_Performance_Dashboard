📊 **Sales Performance Project** 

This project focuses on analyzing key sales data using **Power BI** to uncover trends, monitor KPIs and support data-driven decisions.

📌 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐁𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐟:

📌 **Here’s what I was tasked with:**

1️⃣ Show 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 for 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐬 who bought more than 𝟔 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐭 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐬, excluding ‘𝐈𝐧𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞’ regions.

2️⃣ Build a trendline for 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐥𝐲 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬, again 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬.

3️⃣ Highlight 𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝟓 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐬 𝐛𝐲 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬, excluding the ‘𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬’ category.

4️⃣ Display sales trend across the 𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝟑 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬, with slicers for year and month.

5️⃣ Create a customer-level table for those who purchased in the 𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝟑 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐬, filtered by ‘𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞’ status.

6️⃣ Design a 𝐫𝐮𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 that resets at the start of each month: for 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠.

**Here's a quick walkthrough of the dashboard I created** 👇

📊 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝:

✅ 𝐊𝐏𝐈 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐝:Shows 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 (𝟓𝟎𝟗𝐊) filtered to only include customers who purchased more than 𝟔 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐭 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐬 and excludes '𝐈𝐧𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞' regions.

📈 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐥𝐲 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝: Gives a clean visual of how sales performed month-over-month, again filtered for active regions only.

📉 𝐑𝐮𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐛𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐲: A dynamic measure that resets every month and tracks sales buildup across the days of the current year.

📦 𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝟓 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐬 𝐛𝐲 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬: Focuses only on non-accessory categories, revealing 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐭 & 𝐋𝐚𝐩𝐭𝐨𝐩 as key contributors.

🌍 𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝟑 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐛𝐲 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡: Visualizes sales patterns across 𝐄𝐚𝐬𝐭, 𝐍𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐡 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐖𝐞𝐬𝐭 : uncovering strong peaks in 𝐉𝐮𝐥𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐍𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫.

🧾𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞: Displays only those customers who made purchases in the last 3 months, filtered by active status : helping narrow down valuable segments.


💡 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐝:

✅ Strategic filtering helps spotlight meaningful 𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬 and 𝐭𝐨𝐩-𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 segments.

✅ 𝐑𝐮𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 with reset logic gave clarity into monthly momentum: 𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐩𝐬.

✅ Clean, interactive design isn't just about looks: it invites exploration and smarter decisions.

🧰 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 & 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝:

𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈 | 𝐃𝐀𝐗 | 𝐒𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐬 & 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 | 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠
